Graph:

    edges = hashtable  
    adjacencylist = hashtable  
    node count  
    edge count  

Node stuff:

    id: 1,  
    name: "Johnny",    
    age: 30,  
    outgoing: [1, 3],  
    incoming: [2]  
}  
  
{}          -> indicates node  
var: val    -> indicates variables, types will denoted by the value, if in "" then string else number or bool  
outgoing    -> array of outgoing edges   
incoming    -> array of incoming edges
